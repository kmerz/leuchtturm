## Getting Started

Use `Add Todo` to create a new todo. By pressing long on a todo entry
you can edit or delete a Todo entry.

### Prerequisites

To build the `apk` you need to follow the [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) guide. The guide will explain how to install the android studio needed for build and emulation.


### Installing

After building the apk you can copy it on your android 8.0 phone and install it.

## Running the tests

Since it was fastly prototyped, there is no tests yet. This will be done later (tm). For the brave [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/testing) has a guide for testing.
